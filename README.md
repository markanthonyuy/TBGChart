# TBGChart

Playing with Google Charts

I sliced some data from dashboard.json like

```javascript
"revenue" : {
  "investment_income" : {
     "amount" : "55000",
     "percent" : ""
  },
  "programs" : {
     "amount" : "10000",
     "percent" : "10"
  },
  "fund_raisers" : {
     "amount" : "25000",
     "percent" : "25"
  },
  "contributions_gifts_grants" : {
     "amount" : "10000",
     "percent" : "10"
  }
}
```

and create a pie chart out of that data.
